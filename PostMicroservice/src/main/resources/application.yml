#eureka:      This is the top-level key indicating that the configuration is related to Eureka.
#client:      This specifies that the application is acting as a Eureka client.
#service-url: This is a sub-key specifying the service URLs.
#defaultZone: This is where you set the URL of the Eureka server. In this case, the Eureka
#             server is expected to be running at http://localhost:8761/eureka/. The defaultZone
#             property is a comma-separated list of service URLs, and you can provide multiple
#             Eureka server URLs if you have a cluster of Eureka servers.


#This configuration tells Eureka client in your Spring Boot application to register with the
#Eureka server running at http://localhost:8761/eureka/ & to fetch the registry info from there.
#In a broader context, when your Spring Boot application is running with this configuration, it
#will register itself with the Eureka server so that other services can discover and communicate
#with it. Additionally, your application can discover other services registered with the same
#Eureka server, enabling seamless communication between microservices in a distributed system.
#Make sure that your Eureka server is running at the specified URL (http://localhost:8761/eureka/)
#when your Eureka client application starts.
